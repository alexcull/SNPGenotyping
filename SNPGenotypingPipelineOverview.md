Development and validation of SNP genotyping panel for the
differentiation of Cannabis sativa chemovars
================

## Project description

This repository hosts the code used to develop a SNP-based genotyping
panel. This pipeline combines the work of many others. The primary
objective of sharing this code is to document the exact approach we used
to develop our genotyping panel, largely in an effort to facilitate the
task of others who are seeking to keep track of their cannabis genetics
using PCR-based assays. We suggest that those seeking greater detail
consult the associate article, *Development and validation of SNP
genotyping panel for the differentiation of Cannabis sativa chemovars*,
available [here](link).
